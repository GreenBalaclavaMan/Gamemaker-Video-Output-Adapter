# Gamemaker-Video-Output-Adapter
Made by @GreenBalaclavaMan

A drag and drop solution for adapting a gamemaker project to a variety 
of possible output resolutions and aspect ratios.

Designed to be as simple as possible, consisting of only one object, 
this tool will automatically adapt the viewport resolution to the target 
resolution of a user's display.

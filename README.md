# Gamemaker-Video-Output-Adapter
Made by @GreenBalaclavaMan

Designed to be as simple as possible, consisting of only one object, 
this tool will automatically adapt the viewport resolution to the target 
resolution of a user's display.

Instructions:
To add this to an existing gamemaker project, right click on the "objects" 
heading in gamemaker, and select the "obj_videoOutputAdapter" object included in this repo.
